# Introduction #

In order to make the Lao word detection better, additional words may need to be supported. Once major changes are made, we will do our best to implement these changes into word break and tokenization support for Lao.

The steps needed:
  * Identify the word/s that need added. If you have several words, the best way send them to us is in a text file or document, with each word on its own line.
  * Create an issue in the Issues tab.
  * Use the 'attach a file' and add your file with additions.
  * And submit the issue!

Our team will review the additions for spelling and such, and then add them in.

Thanks for your contributions!
